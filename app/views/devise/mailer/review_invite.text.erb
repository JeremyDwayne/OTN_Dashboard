Dear FIRST NAME,

Thank you for attending the Open Textbook Workshop. We hope it was informative and provided some insights into opportunities to improve student access, affordability, and academic success.

Now, you can make a difference. By writing a brief review, you will help your peers better understand the quality of an open textbook in your field. So, if there is an open textbook in the Open Textbook Library (http://open.umn.edu) that fits your expertise, especially if it fits a course you teach, then please consider writing a review.

The review should be concise: helpful, yet short enough to be useful on the Open Textbook Library (http://open.umn.edu). The review should be completed by REVIEW DEADLINE. After this deadline, your stipend will be processed and sent to you.

Write the review using LINK TO REVIEW SURVEY.

Please contact CONTACT INFO with any questions. Thank you for your efforts.
